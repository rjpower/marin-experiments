"""Device-group microbatched pipeline for the grug-MoE (toward zero-bubble).

Unlike :mod:`pipeline_manual` (logical stages on one
shared mesh, no overlap), here each stage owns a DISJOINT group of devices, so
different stages run concurrently on different hardware -- the prerequisite for
any pipeline speedup. There is no ``stage`` mesh axis, so the stage-stacked
weight-grad that OOMs the GPU partitioner never forms.

Each stage's forward and backward are compiled ONCE (``jax.jit``) and the Python
scheduler calls those compiled functions per microbatch under the stage's
sub-mesh. Compiled stage calls on disjoint device slices dispatch asynchronously,
so the runtime overlaps them. Activations cross stage boundaries by an explicit
``jax.device_put`` to the next stage's sub-mesh; cotangents flow back the same
way. Each stage's blocks are rematerialized (via :func:`_stage_forward`), so only
stage-boundary activations are held and the backward recomputes block internals.

The op order is a :class:`Schedule`. The ``ZERO_BUBBLE`` (ZB-H1) path runs the whole
step from one interleaved :func:`pipeline_schedule`: F, B (input-grad) and W
(weight-grad) ops wavefront across the stages, the backward split so deferred W work
fills the bubble the last stages leave while the backward drains to stage 0.
``ONE_F_ONE_B`` interleaves F with the combined backward in the same wavefront (no W to
defer); ``GPIPE`` is the baseline -- a full forward sweep then a combined-``vjp``
backward sweep, two separate fills with nothing covering the bubble.

    own stage's devices as part of the step, so the optimizer's heavy matmuls pipeline
    across stages with no cross-stage all-gather -- the FSDP grad-exchange the pipeline
    is meant to amortize.

    Stages own disjoint device slices of ``expert_per_stage * data_per_stage`` devices
    each (so ``num_stages * expert_per_stage * data_per_stage == device_count``).

    broadcast off the dispatch thread), or ``INLINE`` (host-staged broadcast inline). No
