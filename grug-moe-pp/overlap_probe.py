"""Isolate why the device-group pipeline serializes: does JAX overlap GPUs at all?

Five micro-probes (1-3 use bare matmuls; 4-5 model the pipeline's dispatch shape):

1. **2-GPU overlap** -- dispatch a heavy kernel on dev0 and dev1, block on both.
   If wall time ~= one kernel, the two GPUs overlap (async works); if ~= two
   kernels, the single-thread eager dispatch is serializing them.
2. **device_put non-blocking** -- time the *dispatch* of a cross-GPU transfer of a
   still-computing array. If it returns immediately the transfer is async; if it
   takes ~a kernel time it is blocking the host thread (which would serialize a
   pipeline that transports between every stage).
3. **8-GPU chain vs fanout** -- a dependent chain dev0->..->dev7 (transport each
   hop) vs 8 independent kernels; the ratio shows whether transported dependencies
   pipeline.
4. **microbatch-major dispatch** -- M microbatches x stages, dispatched mb-major,
   vs the pipelined-ideal and serial bounds; the overlap efficiency.
5. **grug submesh + set_mesh** -- probe 4's shape but on real per-stage grug
   submeshes under ``set_mesh``, to catch overhead the bare matmuls miss.
