"""Does cross-host GPU-to-GPU ``ppermute`` work in multi-controller JAX, and how fast?

The device-group pipeline currently crosses the host boundary by staging the activation
through host memory (``device_get`` + ``broadcast_one_to_all`` or a TCP send). The right
move is an on-device NCCL send/recv -- ``jax.lax.ppermute`` -- which uses GPUDirect RDMA
over InfiniBand and never touches host memory, and which XLA overlaps with compute for
free. The open question is whether a ``shard_map``+``ppermute`` over a mesh that spans
both processes actually lowers and runs under multi-controller JAX (each process only
addresses its local devices), and whether it is meaningfully faster than the host hop.

This probe builds a ``[pp, *act]`` array on a ``(pp=process_count, data=local)`` mesh --
pp rank == process -- from on-device shards (no host staging), ``ppermute``s it one hop
along ``pp`` so each process receives its neighbour's slice, verifies the received tag,
and times the ``ppermute`` against ``broadcast_one_to_all`` of the same bytes.
