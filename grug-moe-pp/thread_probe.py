"""De-risk threaded host dispatch: can a background thread move arrays (device_get /
device_put) while the main thread keeps dispatching jit compute on the same devices?

The device-group multi-host pipeline serializes at the host boundary because the
transport (``device_get`` + cross-host broadcast) runs on the single dispatch thread
and blocks it. The proposed fix is a per-host transport thread that runs the boundary
hop off the critical path while the main thread keeps the local GPUs busy with other
microbatches -- safe to interleave because every host follows the same 1f1b schedule,
so the cross-host collectives stay ordered.

This probe tests only the *mechanics* on one host (no cross-host collective): a worker
thread pulls a still-computing array to the host and pushes it back, while the main
thread dispatches a long chain of independent jit matmuls. It asserts (1) no deadlock /
error from concurrent dispatch + transfer, and (2) the worker's transported result is
numerically correct. It does NOT prove GPU NCCL-concurrency safety -- that needs the
2-node run -- but a failure here kills the approach before spending a cycle.
