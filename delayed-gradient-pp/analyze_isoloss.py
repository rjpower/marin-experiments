"""Token-overhead (iso-loss) analysis for the delayed-gradient / PP cohort.

The headline PP-viability question is not "how big is the loss gap at a fixed
step budget" but "how many *extra tokens* does a delayed (pipeline-parallel) run
need to reach the same loss as synchronous training" -- and whether the gap is a
recoverable token tax or a permanent quality floor.

For each run in a W&B group this pulls the train-loss-vs-step history, takes one
run as the synchronous reference, and reports:

  * plateau    -- robust final loss (trailing raw mean; no boundary smoothing)
  * gap        -- plateau minus the sync run's plateau
  * slope/1k   -- loss change per 1000 steps over the tail (a still-negative
                  slope means the run is still descending == token tax, not a
                  converged quality floor)
  * overhead   -- token-overhead multiplier: the step at which this run reaches
                  its own plateau loss, divided by the step at which the sync run
                  first reached that same loss (tokens = steps * batch for a
                  fixed batch). This is the "extra tokens to match" number that
                  feeds the throughput break-even in pp_throughput_model.py.

Smoothing is edge-safe (a centered rolling mean with ``min_periods``) so the tail
is not dragged toward zero -- a plain ``np.convolve(mode="same")`` pads with
zeros and corrupts exactly the final-loss region this analysis depends on.
